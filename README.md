# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Classifier. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals by providing an early warning system based on patient data.


Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the risk of heart disease. By comparing two algorithms, KNN and Random Forest, we aim to identify the best model for accurate predictions.


◉ Features

Predicts the presence or absence of heart disease.
Allows comparison between KNN and Random Forest models.
Provides an interpretable interface for predictions.
Includes data preprocessing and feature selection.

◉ Dataset

We used the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains 14 attributes for 303 patients. These attributes include:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak)


◉ Technologies Used


Python (version 3.12 or higher)
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical computations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation


Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)

Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)
Target variable: Presence of heart disease (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
